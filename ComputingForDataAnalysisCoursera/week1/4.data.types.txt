Many persons who are not conversant with mathemtical studies
imagine that because the business of Babbage's Analytical Engine' 
is to give its results in numerical notation, the 
nature of its processes must consequenctly be arithmetical
and numerical, rather than algebraical and analytical. This is an error.
The engine can arrange and combine its numerical quantities exactly as if
they were letters or any other general symbols, and in fact
it might bring out its results in algebraical notation, were provisions
made accordingly. Augusta Ada
